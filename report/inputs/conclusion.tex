EDA and preprocessing revealed key patterns and ensured clean input.

While the naive item-mean model set a strong benchmark, collaborative filtering showed limited gains due to sparse user data. The content-based model, however, effectively utilized profile features like gender ratios and popularity, delivering the best performance.

Our findings highlight the value of profile attributes in user preference modeling, and suggest future gains through enhanced features or hybrid models.
